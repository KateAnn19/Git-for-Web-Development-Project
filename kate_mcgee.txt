     the element is a child of the first selected element—that is, only when 
     it is directly contained within the first selected element. These can be
    useful in situations when an attribute needs to go onto an element without changing other attributes it is already using or will use.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    **an inline element does not cause a line break(start on a new line) and does not take
     up the full width of the page. It is only the space bounded by its' opening and closing tag. It is usually used within other HTML elements.
     A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right. A 
     block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element.
   
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    **The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the 
    element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, 
    if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position
     is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. 
The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins.**


    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability 
    to give it a width? 
    **

    display: block

    **

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by 
    default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default 
    ** 1. <div> 2. <address> 3. Nav>      1. <span> 2.  <a></a>    1. display: inline-block; **

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    ** All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model is essentially a box that 
    wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. CSS
    display properties allow us to overcome some of the shortcomings of the box model**
